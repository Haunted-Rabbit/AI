 The Minimax algorithm transforms  Tic-Tac-Toe game into an unbeatable AI opponent by simulating all possible moves and choosing the optimal strategy. This project demonstrates core concepts in game theory, recursion, and adversarial decision-making. While the AI always plays perfectly, future enhancements could include difficulty levels or optimizations like alpha-beta pruning. By integrating this AI, Iâ€™ve not only elevated the game but also gained hands-on experience with foundational AI techniques.
